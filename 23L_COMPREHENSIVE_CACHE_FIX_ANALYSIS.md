# 23L Framework: Comprehensive Cache Fix Analysis

## Layer 1: Expertise - Critical Findings from Console
- **Service Worker Unregistration Failed**: "Unregistered service worker: false"
- **Cache Deleted**: "Deleted cache life-ceo-v4: true" 
- **Page Still Blank**: Despite cache clearing, content not loading

## Layer 2: Research - Root Cause Identification
From console logs:
1. Service worker exists but won't unregister
2. Multiple service worker registrations may be conflicting
3. Vite/Replit dev environment may have additional caching layers

## Layer 5: Data Architecture - Cache Hierarchy
1. **Service Worker**: Still active despite unregistration attempts
2. **Browser Cache**: May be controlled by service worker
3. **Vite Dev Server**: Has its own module cache
4. **Replit CDN**: May cache static assets

## Layer 7: Frontend - Immediate Fix Implementation
Need to:
1. Force service worker termination
2. Add no-cache headers to HTML
3. Bypass all caching mechanisms
4. Add timestamp to all resource URLs

## Layer 10: Infrastructure - Development Environment
Vite HMR shows updates but browser doesn't reflect them
This indicates a proxy/CDN layer is caching responses

## Layer 21: Production Resilience - Nuclear Option
Complete cache bypass strategy:
1. Rename all files to force new URLs
2. Add random query parameters
3. Disable ALL caching headers
4. Force reload without service worker

## Layer 23: Business Continuity - Recovery Steps
1. Stop all service workers from DevTools
2. Clear all site data manually
3. Open in new incognito window
4. Disable cache in DevTools Network tab
