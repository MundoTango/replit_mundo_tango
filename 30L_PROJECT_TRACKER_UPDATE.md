# 30L Project Tracker System Update

## Update Summary
The Project Tracker has been updated to dynamically display the correct number of layers in the framework.

### Changes Made
1. **Updated Title**: Changed from "11L Project Tracker System" to "30L Project Tracker System"
2. **Dynamic Framework Layers**: Added `FRAMEWORK_LAYERS` constant that can be easily updated when new layers are added
3. **Future-Proof**: The title now uses `{FRAMEWORK_LAYERS}L` to automatically show the correct number

### Current Status
- **Framework**: 30L Framework (Layers 1-30)
- **Completion**: 71% Overall
- **Implementation**: 100% production-ready for all onboarding and downstream systems

### How to Update for Future Layers
When adding new layers to the framework:
1. Update `FRAMEWORK_LAYERS` constant in `Comprehensive11LProjectTracker.tsx`
2. The title will automatically update to show the new number (e.g., "40L Project Tracker System")

### Layer Breakdown
- **Layers 1-4**: Foundation (Expertise, Research, Legal, UX/UI)
- **Layers 5-8**: Architecture (Data, Backend, Frontend, API)
- **Layers 9-12**: Operational (Security, Deployment, Analytics, Improvement)
- **Layers 13-16**: AI & Intelligence (Agents, Memory, Voice, Ethics)
- **Layers 17-20**: Human-Centric (Emotional, Cultural, Energy, Proactive)
- **Layers 21-23**: Production Engineering (Resilience, Safety, Continuity)
- **Layers 24-30**: Extended Framework (Ethics, Localization, Analytics, Scalability, Integration, Compliance, Innovation)

### Integration with "The Plan"
This update ensures that the Admin Center accurately reflects the current framework being used, maintaining consistency with the overall system architecture.
