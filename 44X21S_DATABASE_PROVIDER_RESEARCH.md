## FINAL VERDICT REINFORCED

After comprehensive 44x21s research across external sources and technical analysis, the recommendation remains: **Stay with Supabase and maximize Life CEO AI capabilities**.

**Evidence Supporting This Decision**:
1. **Working Solution**: Life CEO AI already provides superior database analysis (10MB vs 1MB)
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Migration costs (18-48 hours) exceed potential savings
3. **Feature Gaps**: All alternatives require additional services (auth, real-time, storage)
4. **Team Productivity**: Zero learning curve vs weeks of migration complexity
5. **Business Focus**: Energy better spent on user features than infrastructure changes

**Monitor These Triggers for Future Re-evaluation**:
- Supabase pricing increases >50%
