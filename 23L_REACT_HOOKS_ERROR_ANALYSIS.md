# 23L Framework Analysis: React Hooks Error in System Health Integration

## Executive Summary
Critical React hooks violation causing "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error. Must fix hook placement immediately.

## Layer 1: Expertise & Technical Proficiency
**React Hooks Rules**:
1. Only call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React functions
3. Always call hooks in the same order
4. Never call hooks conditionally

**Error Analysis**:
- renderSystemHealth contains useState hooks
- It's called conditionally based on selectedTab
- This violates hooks rules

## Layer 2: Research & Discovery
**Error Messages**:
```
Warning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by AdminCenter
Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render
```

**Root Cause**:
- Added useState hooks inside renderSystemHealth function
- renderSystemHealth is called conditionally from renderContent()
- When tab changes, hooks are called in different order

## Layer 3: Legal & Compliance
- No legal issues
- Code quality standards violated

## Layer 4: UX/UI Design
- Error prevents UI from rendering
- Must maintain same visual design after fix

## Layer 5: Data Architecture
**State Management Issues**:
- isRefreshing state
- performanceKey state
- systemMetrics state
- All incorrectly placed inside conditional function

## Layer 6: Backend Development
- No backend changes needed

## Layer 7: Frontend Development
**Solution Options**:
1. Move all state to AdminCenter component level
2. Convert renderSystemHealth to proper component
3. Use callback pattern without hooks

**Best Solution**: Move state to AdminCenter level

## Layer 8: API & Integration
- No API changes required

## Layer 9: Security & Authentication
- No security impact

## Layer 10: Deployment & Infrastructure
- Fix prevents deployment
- Must resolve before production

## Layer 11: Analytics & Monitoring
- Error tracking shows hooks violation
- Performance impact from crashes

## Layer 12: Continuous Improvement
- Add ESLint rules for hooks
- Code review for hook patterns

## Layer 13-16: AI & Intelligence
- Not applicable

## Layer 17: Emotional Intelligence
- User frustrated by error
- Need quick resolution

## Layer 18: Cultural Awareness
- Standard React patterns expected

## Layer 19: Energy Management
- Error causes repeated re-renders
- Wastes resources

## Layer 20: Proactive Intelligence
- Implement hooks linting
- Training on hooks rules

## Layer 21: Production Resilience Engineering
**Critical Production Blocker**:
- Application crashes on System Health tab
- Error boundary catches but shows error
- Must fix immediately

## Layer 22: User Safety Net
- Error boundary prevents full crash
- But functionality lost

## Layer 23: Business Continuity
- Admin functionality blocked
- Monitoring disabled

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Fix
1. Move state declarations to AdminCenter component
2. Pass state and setters to renderSystemHealth
3. Remove hooks from renderSystemHealth

### Code Changes Required
```javascript
// In AdminCenter component (top level)
const [systemHealthRefreshing, setSystemHealthRefreshing] = useState(false);
const [performanceKey, setPerformanceKey] = useState(0);
const [systemMetrics, setSystemMetrics] = useState({
  uptime: 99.9,
  responseTime: 127,
  databaseLoad: 23,
  storageUsed: 67
});

// Pass to renderSystemHealth
const renderSystemHealth = () => {
  // Use passed props, no hooks here
}
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ No hooks errors
- ✅ System Health tab loads
- ✅ Refresh functionality works
- ✅ Performance Monitor displays
- ✅ All metrics update

## Risk Mitigation
- Test all tabs after fix
- Verify no other conditional hooks
- Add hooks linting rules
