# Migration Notes and Changes

This document outlines the key changes, improvements, and decisions made during the migration from TrangoTech MySQL to Supabase PostgreSQL.

## Major Structural Changes

### 1. Primary Key Migration
**Before:** MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT integers  
**After:** UUID with `uuid_generate_v4()`

**Reason:** UUIDs provide better distributed system support, eliminate sequence conflicts, and integrate seamlessly with Supabase Auth.

### 2. Authentication Integration
**Before:** Custom user table with password hashing  
**After:** Integration with Supabase Auth + extended user profiles

**Changes:**
- Added `auth_user_id` column linking to `auth.users`
- Moved authentication logic to Supabase Auth
- Preserved all custom user fields in extended `users` table

### 3. Geographic Data Enhancement
**Before:** Separate latitude/longitude columns  
**After:** PostGIS GEOGRAPHY columns + preserved coordinate fields

**Benefits:**
- Native geographic queries and indexing
- Distance calculations
- Spatial relationship queries
- Backward compatibility with existing coordinate fields

### 4. Security Implementation
**Before:** Application-level access control  
**After:** Database-level Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Policies Added:**
- User profile visibility controls
- Friend-based content access
- Post visibility enforcement
- Chat room membership validation
- Event participation verification

## Data Type Conversions

### MySQL → PostgreSQL Mappings
- `TINYINT(1)` → `BOOLEAN`
- `DATETIME` → `TIMESTAMPTZ`
- `TEXT` → `TEXT` (no change)
- `VARCHAR(n)` → `VARCHAR(n)` (no change)
- `INT` → `INTEGER` (for counts/IDs) or `UUID` (for references)
- `ENUM` → `VARCHAR` with CHECK constraints
- `GEOMETRY` → `GEOGRAPHY(POINT)` (PostGIS)

### New Data Types Added
- `JSONB` for flexible metadata storage
- `TEXT[]` for array fields (languages, skills, etc.)
- `GEOGRAPHY` for precise location data
- `DECIMAL` for financial values (event pricing)

## Schema Enhancements

### 1. Improved Indexing Strategy
**New Indexes:**
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- GiST indexes for geographic data
- Partial indexes for active/visible content
- Full-text search preparation

### 2. Enhanced Constraints
**Added Constraints:**
- CHECK constraints for enum-like values
- UNIQUE constraints for business logic
- NOT NULL constraints for required fields
- Foreign key constraints with proper CASCADE behavior

### 3. Trigger Automation
**New Triggers:**
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Engagement count maintenance (likes, comments, shares)
- Data integrity validation
- Audit trail preparation

## Table-Specific Changes

### users table
- Added Supabase Auth integration
- Enhanced location fields with PostGIS
- Converted boolean flags from TINYINT
- Added structured metadata fields

### posts table
- Enhanced visibility controls
- Added engagement metrics automation
- Improved location tracking
- Added sharing functionality

### chat_messages table
- Added message types (text, image, video, etc.)
- Enhanced reply functionality
- Added edit tracking
- Improved status management

### events table
- Added timezone support
- Enhanced pricing structure
- Improved RSVP system
- Added geographic search capability

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Row-Level Security Policies
**Content Visibility:**
- Public posts visible to all
- Friend posts restricted to connections
- Private posts only to author
- Group content to members only

**User Privacy:**
- Blocked user enforcement
- Profile visibility controls
- Activity hiding options

### 2. API Security
**Authentication:**
- JWT token validation via Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control
- Session management

**Data Protection:**
- SQL injection prevention via prepared statements
- XSS protection through data sanitization
- CSRF protection via token validation

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Query Performance
**Indexes Added:**
- User activity indexes (user_id + created_at)
- Content visibility filters
- Geographic proximity searches
- Full-text search preparation

### 2. Data Efficiency
**Optimizations:**
- Denormalized engagement counts
- Cached relationship data
- Efficient pagination support
- Optimized JOIN patterns

## Backward Compatibility

### 1. Preserved Fields
**Maintained:**
- All original data fields
- Existing field names (camelCase conversion)
- Original data relationships
- Business logic constraints

### 2. API Compatibility
**Ensured:**
- Same response structures
- Identical field names in API responses
- Preserved data validation rules
- Maintained error codes

## Migration Risks and Mitigations

### 1. Data Loss Prevention
**Safeguards:**
- Complete schema backup before migration
- Validation queries for data integrity
- Rollback procedures documented
- Test environment validation

### 2. Performance Risks
**Mitigations:**
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- Query performance testing
- Connection pooling configuration
- Cache warming procedures

### 3. Feature Compatibility
**Validations:**
- All original features mapped to new schema
- API endpoint compatibility verified
- Frontend integration tested
- Real-time features validated

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Data Integrity Tests
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Unique constraint verification
- Data type conversion accuracy
- Business rule enforcement

### 2. Performance Tests
- Query response time benchmarks
- Concurrent user load testing
- Geographic query performance
- Real-time subscription performance

### 3. Security Tests
- RLS policy validation
- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization boundary verification
- Data leak prevention
