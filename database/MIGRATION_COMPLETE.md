## ðŸ”§ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Visit supabase.com and create new project
2. Choose database password and wait for setup
3. Note project URL and API keys

### 2. Run Migration
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste `supabase_migration.sql` content
3. Execute to create all 55 tables with relationships
4. Verify successful creation in Table Editor

### 3. Add Test Data (Optional)
1. Copy and paste `seed_data.sql` content in SQL Editor
2. Execute to populate with realistic test data
3. Browse tables to verify data insertion

### 4. Configure Application
```bash
# Set environment variables
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 5. Test Migration
```bash
# Validate migration success
npm run db:test-supabase
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Options

### Option 1: Gradual Migration
Use the `databaseAdapter` service to gradually switch endpoints from PostgreSQL to Supabase while testing functionality.

### Option 2: Complete Switch
Update `DATABASE_URL` to Supabase connection string for immediate full migration.

### Option 3: Parallel Running
Run both databases simultaneously during testing phase before final cutover.
