# 23L Framework Analysis: mapUrl Reference Error Fix

## Layer 1: Expertise & Issue Identification
- **Error**: "ReferenceError: mapUrl is not defined"
- **Location**: LocationStep.tsx line 421
- **Context**: Occurs when using address autocomplete in host onboarding

## Layer 2: Research & Discovery
- Found iframe element trying to use undefined `mapUrl` variable
- This is leftover code from Google Maps implementation
- Need to replace with Leaflet map component

## Layer 3: Legal & Compliance
- OpenStreetMap has permissive license for commercial use
- No API keys required, reducing compliance burden
- Attribution requirement satisfied

## Layer 4: UX/UI Design
- Map preview should show property location
- Consistent with main map interface
- Disable scroll zoom for better UX

## Layer 5: Data Architecture
- Latitude/longitude already stored correctly
- No database changes needed

## Layer 6: Backend Development
- No backend changes required
- Using existing coordinates from form data

## Layer 7: Frontend Development
### Root Cause
- iframe element at line 420-428 references undefined `mapUrl`
- Variable was never declared after Google Maps removal

### Solution Implemented
- Removed iframe element
- Replaced with MapContainer component
- Used same Leaflet/OpenStreetMap setup as main map
- Set zoom to 15 for detailed preview
- Disabled scroll wheel zoom for better UX

## Layer 8: API & Integration
- No API changes needed
- OpenStreetMap tiles load directly

## Layer 9: Security & Authentication
- No security implications
- Map tiles are public resources

## Layer 10: Deployment & Infrastructure
- No deployment changes needed
- Using CDN-hosted map tiles

## Layer 11: Analytics & Monitoring
- Error tracked in console logs
- Fixed prevents user frustration

## Layer 12: Continuous Improvement
- Consider adding map style options
- Could add satellite view option

## Layers 13-16: AI & Automation
- Map interactions could be enhanced with AI
- Location suggestions based on user patterns

## Layers 17-20: Human-Centric
- Map preview helps users verify location
- Visual confirmation reduces errors

## Layers 21-23: Production Engineering
- Error boundary would have caught this
- Added proper error handling
- No performance impact

## Test Plan
1. Navigate to /host-onboarding
2. Go to Location step
3. Use address autocomplete
4. Verify no errors occur
5. Check map preview displays correctly
