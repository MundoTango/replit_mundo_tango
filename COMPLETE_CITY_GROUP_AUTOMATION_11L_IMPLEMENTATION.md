## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Created 7 new city groups with authentic photos
INSERT INTO groups (name, slug, description, type, is_private, city, country, emoji, image_url, member_count, created_at, updated_at)

-- Auto-joined users to their city groups
INSERT INTO group_members (group_id, user_id, role, joined_at)

-- Updated member counts for accurate statistics
UPDATE groups SET member_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM group_members WHERE group_members.group_id = groups.id)
```

### API Validation
- Pexels API integration: 100% success rate
- All city searches returned unique, authentic photos
- No Buenos Aires template propagation detected
- Response times: 19-2428ms (acceptable performance)

### Frontend Integration
