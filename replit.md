# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform

## Overview

**UPDATE (July 22, 2025 - Memories Feed as Home Page)**: Fixed routing to show Memories feed at root URL
- **Issue**: "/" route was incorrectly showing Life CEO interface instead of Memories feed
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Changed "/" route to display EnhancedTimelineV2 (Memories feed) component
  - Moved Life CEO interface to "/life-ceo" route
  - Added proper lazy loading with Suspense for both routes
- **Result**: Memories feed now displays at the root URL "/" as requested
- **Routes**: "/" = Memories feed, "/life-ceo" = Life CEO interface, "/feed" = Original home feed

**UPDATE (July 22, 2025 - Build Memory Optimization)**: Fixed JavaScript heap out of memory errors during build
- **Issue**: Build process failing with "JavaScript heap out of memory" due to large bundle size
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Created `.env.build` with NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=8192" for 8GB memory allocation
  - Created `build-optimize.sh` script for optimized builds
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in performance-optimizations.ts (RequestBatcher type parameters)
  - Fixed storage method errors in lifeCeoPerformanceService.ts
  - Implemented lazy loading for all non-critical components (already in place)
- **Build Command**: Use `NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=8192" npm run build` or run `./build-optimize.sh`
- **Results**: Build completes successfully in ~90 seconds without memory errors
- **Note**: Profile page bundle is large (31MB) - consider further code splitting in future

**UPDATE (July 22, 2025 - MT Ocean Theme Design Restoration)**: Restored Beautiful Glassmorphic MT Design
- **Issue**: During performance debugging, the beautiful MT ocean theme with glassmorphic styling was lost, replaced by plain gray design
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Restored gradient backgrounds: `bg-gradient-to-br from-turquoise-50 via-cyan-50 to-blue-50`
  - Applied glassmorphic card styling: `glassmorphic-card` with backdrop blur effects
  - Updated all components with turquoise-to-cyan gradients
  - Restored avatar rings, gradient buttons, and ocean-themed colors
  - Fixed PostCard, CreatePost, and Home components
- **Design Standards**: MT Ocean Theme uses:
  - Primary gradients: turquoise (#38b2ac) to cyan (#06b6d4)
  - Glassmorphic cards with white/85% opacity and backdrop blur
  - Turquoise borders and hover states
  - Gradient text for headings and important elements

## Overview

**IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE (January 2025)**: System is being restructured from a monolithic platform into separate, independent systems:

1. **Life CEO System**: AI-powered life management platform with 16 specialized agents managing all aspects of Scott Boddye's life
2. **Community Platforms**: Independent social communities (starting with Mundo Tango) with complete data isolation
3. **Integration Layer**: API-based communication between systems maintaining strict boundaries

The new architecture ensures true system independence while enabling optional cross-platform features.

**UPDATE (January 6, 2025)**: Phase 1 Foundation Implementation Complete
- Created separate database schemas for Life CEO and community template systems
- Built API gateway infrastructure for secure inter-system communication
- Implemented base agent architecture with Business Agent as first concrete implementation
- Developed mobile-first React interface optimized for Scott's primary usage pattern
- Established complete system separation with API-based communication only

## New System Architecture (January 2025)

### Architecture Overview
The platform is being separated into three independent systems:

```
1. Life CEO System (life-ceo/)
   - 16 AI agents managing different life aspects
   - Independent PostgreSQL database with vector storage
   - Mobile-first voice interface
   - OpenAI integration for agent intelligence

2. Community Platforms (communities/)
   - mundo-tango/ - Tango community instance
   - template/ - Reusable community template
   - Each community has independent database
   - Complete data isolation between communities

3. Integration Layer (integration/)
   - API Gateway for routing between systems  
   - Authentication bridge with SSO support
   - Data contracts for cross-system communication
   - Optional unified dashboard (unified-dashboard/)
```

### Key Architectural Principles
- **Complete System Independence**: Life CEO and communities run as separate microservices
- **Data Sovereignty**: Each system owns its data with no shared databases
- **API-First Communication**: All cross-system interaction via versioned APIs
- **User Choice**: Users can view systems individually or in unified mode
- **Buenos Aires Context**: Life CEO agents aware of Scott's location and culture

### Life CEO System Implementation Details

#### Database Schema (life-ceo/database/schema.sql)
- **life_ceo.users**: Core user table linking to SSO/authentication
- **life_ceo.agents**: 16 agent configurations with permissions and priorities
- **life_ceo.agent_memories**: Vector-enabled memory storage for semantic search
- **life_ceo.tasks**: Agent task management with priorities and due dates
- **life_ceo.agent_messages**: Inter-agent communication system
- **life_ceo.voice_commands**: Voice command history with transcripts
