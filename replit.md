- June 30, 2025. Comprehensive testing strategy implementation completed:
  * Built complete testing infrastructure spanning unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library), integration tests (Supertest), database tests (pg-mem), end-to-end tests (Cypress + Playwright), and performance tests (k6)
  * Created comprehensive test configurations: jest.config.js, cypress.config.ts, playwright.config.ts with proper coverage thresholds and multi-browser support
  * Implemented testing framework supporting frontend component testing, backend API validation, database integrity checks, cross-browser compatibility, and load testing
  * Established 70% code coverage requirements across branches, functions, lines, and statements with automated reporting
  * Built performance testing suite with k6 validating response times under 500ms (95th percentile), error rates below 5%, and concurrent user handling up to 20+ users
  * Created test data management system with database seeding, cleanup procedures, and isolation between test cases
  * Generated COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md documenting complete testing approach, coverage requirements, CI/CD integration, and maintenance procedures
  * Testing infrastructure ready for reliability and stability validation across all application layers
- June 30, 2025. Complete testing infrastructure validation and system stability verification completed:
