# Mundo Tango - Social Media Platform

## Overview

Mundo Tango is a modern full-stack social media application designed for the global tango community. It's built as a progressive web application with real-time features, allowing users to connect, share posts, organize events, and engage in messaging.

## System Architecture

The application follows a clean, modern full-stack architecture:

### Frontend

- **Language**: JavaScript with TypeScript support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for API state
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for file-based routing
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in bundler
- **UI Library**: React with Tailwind CSS custom components

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server for live messaging and notifications
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling media uploads
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Connection**: @neondatabase/serverless for optimal performance

## Key Components
