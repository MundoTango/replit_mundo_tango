# Mundo Tango - Social Media Platform

## Overview

Mundo Tango is a modern full-stack social media application designed for the global tango community. It's built as a progressive web application with real-time features, allowing users to connect, share posts, organize events, and engage in messaging.

## System Architecture

The application follows a clean, modern full-stack architecture:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server for live messaging and notifications
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling media uploads
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Connection**: @neondatabase/serverless for optimal performance

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes with middleware
- Persistent sessions with local storage

### Social Media Features
- User profiles with customizable information
- Post creation with image/video support
- Like, comment, and share functionality
- Stories with view tracking
- Follow/unfollow user relationships

### Real-time Messaging
- WebSocket-based chat system
- Private and group messaging
- Real-time message delivery
- Chat room management

### Event Management
- Event creation and RSVP system
- Calendar integration
- Location-based event discovery
- Event attendance tracking

### Media Handling
- File upload system for images and videos
- Profile and background image management
- Secure file storage with validation

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React frontend makes API calls through React Query
2. **Authentication**: JWT middleware validates user tokens
3. **Data Processing**: Express routes handle business logic
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket server pushes live updates to connected clients
6. **File Handling**: Multer processes and stores uploaded media files

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Query)
- Express.js with TypeScript support
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL adapter
- Radix UI component primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Authentication & Security
- jsonwebtoken for JWT handling
- bcrypt for password hashing
- CORS and security middleware

### File & Media Handling
- multer for file uploads
- File type validation and size limits

### Real-time Features
- ws (WebSocket) library for real-time communication
- Custom socket service for message handling

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development
- ESBuild for production builds
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- tsx for running TypeScript server in development
- PostgreSQL database connection via environment variables

### Production Build
1. Frontend built with Vite to static assets
2. Backend bundled with ESBuild as ES modules
3. Single Node.js process serves both frontend and API
4. PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon (serverless)

### Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (uploads directory)
- **WebSocket**: Integrated with Express server

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
- `JWT_SECRET` for authentication security
- `NODE_ENV` for environment-specific behavior
