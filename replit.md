🏗️ 11 LAYERS SYSTEM FOR ANALYSIS + IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Expertise Layer** — Identify required expertise (full-stack, security, AI, etc.)
2. **Open Source Scan Layer** — Research libraries, SDKs, public repos for implementation
3. **Legal & Compliance Layer** — Consider privacy, GDPR, legal risks and requirements
4. **Consent & UX Safeguards Layer** — Define visibility defaults, user controls, ethical considerations
5. **Data Layer** — Design schema, tables, relationships, RLS policies, query optimization
6. **Backend Layer** — Create API endpoints, server functions, triggers, business logic
7. **Frontend Layer** — Build pages, components, tabs, modals with responsive design
8. **Sync & Automation Layer** — Implement webhooks, events, scheduled jobs, real-time features
9. **Security & Permissions Layer** — Configure RBAC/ABAC logic, scoped access, authentication
10. **AI & Reasoning Layer** — Add suggestions, summarization, tagging, AI-driven features
11. **Testing & Observability Layer** — Build tests, logs, monitors, performance tracking

REWRITING PROTOCOL:
- When receiving unstructured input, re-analyze using 11L system
- Rewrite as fully structured Replit-ready implementation prompt
- Include scoped actions and technical coverage across all layers
- Always reference existing implementations, include open-source tool URLs, coordinate API contracts
- Provide implementation summaries with next steps and testing validation
