1. **User Account Creation**
   - Email validation
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Username uniqueness check
   - Replit OAuth integration

### Phase 2: Onboarding (onboarding.tsx)
1. **Profile Setup**
   - Nickname assignment (required, max 50 chars)
   - Language selection (multi-select from predefined list)
   - Tango role selection (optional, maps to professional groups)
   - Dance experience levels (leader 0-10, follower 0-10)

   - DJ ‚Üí DJs United
   - Organizer ‚Üí Event Organizers
   - Performer ‚Üí Performers Guild
   - etc.

**Trigger**: Location selection
**Process**:
1. Show events in user's city
2. Filter by dance level
3. Show upcoming milongas
**Reliability**: 60% - Basic geo-filtering only

### 8. Role-Based Permissions ‚úÖ
**Trigger**: Role selection
**Process**:
1. Grant role-specific permissions
2. Enable role features (e.g., DJ playlist management)
3. Show role-specific UI elements
**Reliability**: 85% - RBAC system working

### 9. Analytics Tracking ‚úÖ
**Trigger**: All onboarding steps
**Process**:
1. Track completion rates
2. Log user choices
3. Monitor drop-off points
**Reliability**: 90% - Plausible Analytics integrated

### 10. Data Validation & Sanitization ‚úÖ
**Trigger**: All form submissions
**Process**:
1. Zod schema validation
2. SQL injection prevention
3. XSS protection
**Reliability**: 95% - Well-implemented

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Race Condition in City Group Creation üö®
**Problem**: Multiple users registering for same city simultaneously could create duplicate groups
**Impact**: Data integrity issues
**Fix Required**: Add database transaction with lock

### 2. Missing Error Recovery üö®
**Problem**: If professional group assignment fails, user is stuck
**Impact**: Incomplete onboarding
**Fix Required**: Add retry mechanism and manual recovery

### 3. No Rollback Mechanism üö®
**Problem**: If onboarding fails partway, partial data remains
**Impact**: Inconsistent user state
**Fix Required**: Implement transaction rollback

### 4. Location Validation Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: Google Maps data not validated against known cities
**Impact**: Invalid city groups could be created
**Fix Required**: Add city validation service

### 5. Performance Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Recommended Improvements

### Immediate (P0):
1. Fix race condition in city group creation
2. Add transaction rollback for failed onboarding
3. Implement error recovery mechanisms
4. Add comprehensive logging

### Short-term (P1):
1. Implement welcome email automation
2. Add friend suggestion algorithm
3. Enhance event recommendations
4. Add performance caching

### Long-term (P2):

4. Voice onboarding option

## Conclusion

The current onboarding automation system is **functional but not production-ready**. While core features work, critical reliability and scalability issues need addressing before public launch. The system achieves basic automation goals but lacks the sophistication expected in a modern platform.

**Recommendation**: Implement P0 fixes immediately before any production deployment.
