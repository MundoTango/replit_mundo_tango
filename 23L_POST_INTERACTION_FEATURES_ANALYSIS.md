# 23L Framework Analysis: Post Interaction Features

## Executive Summary
Analysis of post interaction features (like, comment, share, report) in Mundo Tango platform to ensure full functionality and brand compliance.

## Layer 1: Expertise & Technical Proficiency
### Current Implementation Status
- **EnhancedPostItem.tsx**: Primary component with all social features
- **Facebook-style Reactions**: 6 reactions (like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry)
- **Rich Text Comments**: Mentions support with @username
- **Share System**: Multiple share options (timeline, with comment, copy link)
- **Report System**: Integrated modal with categories

## Layer 2: Research & Discovery
### Feature Inventory
1. **Reactions**
   - Component: `FacebookReactionSelector`
   - API: `POST /api/memories/:id/reactions`
   - Current reaction tracking
   - Real-time updates via query invalidation

2. **Comments**
   - Component: `RichTextCommentEditor`
   - API: `POST /api/memories/:id/comments`
   - Rich text with mentions
   - Nested comment display

3. **Share**

   - Categories: Harassment, Inappropriate, Spam, etc.

## Layer 3: Legal & Compliance
### Content Moderation

- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Layer 4: UX/UI Design
### Current Branding Implementation
✅ **Color Scheme**

- Coral/Pink: Highlights, mentions
- Green: Share actions
- Purple: Special features

✅ **Interaction States**
- Hover effects with brand colors
- Smooth transitions (200ms)
- Scale effects on hover
- Gradient backgrounds

## Layer 5: Data Architecture
### API Endpoints
- `/api/memories/:id/reactions` - Reaction management
- `/api/memories/:id/comments` - Comment system
- `/api/memories/:id/share` - Share functionality
- `/api/memories/:id/report` - Content reporting

## Layer 6: Backend Development
### Mutation Handlers
```typescript
// Reaction mutation with proper error handling
reactionMutation: POST with reaction type
commentMutation: POST with content and mentions
reportMutation: POST with reason and description
shareToWallMutation: POST with optional comment
```

## Layer 7: Frontend Development
### Component Integration
- EnhancedPostItem: Main post display
- FacebookReactionSelector: Reaction UI
- RichTextCommentEditor: Comment input
- PostContextMenu: Additional actions
- ReportModal: Report interface

## Layer 8: API & Integration
### Real-time Updates
- Query invalidation on mutations
- Optimistic updates for reactions
- Comment count synchronization

## Layer 9: Security & Authentication
### User Permissions
- Owner-only edit/delete
- Authenticated reactions/comments
- Role-based moderation access

## Layer 10: Deployment & Infrastructure
### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for comments
- Debounced reaction updates
- Efficient query caching

## Issues Found & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Component Usage
**Problem**: Multiple post components (PostItem, EnhancedPostItem, PostCard)
**Resolution**: Standardize on EnhancedPostItem for all feeds

### Issue 2: Missing Brand Colors
**Problem**: Some hover states using generic gray
**Resolution**: Update to use brand colors consistently

### Issue 3: API Path Consistency
**Problem**: Mix of /posts and /memories endpoints
**Resolution**: Use apiBasePath variable for consistency
