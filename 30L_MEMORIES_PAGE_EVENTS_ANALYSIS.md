# 30L Framework Analysis: Memories Page Events Display Issue

## Current State Analysis

### Layer 1-4: Foundation & Technical Proficiency
- **Component Structure**: EventsBoard properly integrated in Memories page sidebar
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/events/sidebar` returning 200 OK status
- **Data Flow**: Component fetching data with React Query
- **UI Framework**: Using MT design system with turquoise/blue theme

### Layer 5-8: Architecture & Development
- **Frontend**: EventsBoard shows loading state, then renders events or empty state
- **Backend**: API endpoint working (confirmed in logs)
- **Data Issue**: Likely no upcoming events in database or visibility filtering
- **Integration**: Properly connected with authentication context

### Layer 9-12: Security & Deployment
- **Authentication**: Using session-based auth with fallback to default user
- **Error States**: Component has proper error handling
- **Performance**: Using React Query for caching
- **Monitoring**: Need better debugging for empty results

### Layer 13-16: AI & Intelligence
- **Smart Filtering**: Events filtered by user area and invitations
- **Recommendations**: Could add AI-based event suggestions
- **Context Awareness**: Using user location for relevant events

### Layer 17-20: Human-Centric & Cultural
- **UX Design**: Clean, compact sidebar design
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels needed
- **Localization**: Date/time formatting for user locale
- **Engagement**: Visual indicators for RSVP status

### Layer 21-23: Production Engineering
- **Error Tracking**: Need to log when API returns empty arrays
- **Data Validation**: Should verify event data structure
- **User Feedback**: Add message when no events due to filters

### Layer 24-30: Advanced Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Could use WebSocket for live event updates
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper cache invalidation
- **Analytics**: Track event view/click rates
- **Scale**: Pagination for large event lists

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **No Events in Database**: Most likely cause - need to check if events exist
2. **Date Filtering**: Events might be in past or too far in future
3. **Location Filtering**: User's location might not match any events
4. **Visibility Rules**: Private events not showing for user

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Enhanced EventsBoard with Debug Mode
- Add debug info to see what data is being fetched
- Show filter criteria being applied
- Display total events vs filtered events

### 2. Improved Empty State
- Explain why no events are showing
- Provide actionable next steps
- Link to create event or browse all

### 3. Flexible Filtering
- Allow expanding search radius
- Show events from nearby cities
- Include online/virtual events

### 4. Better Data Seeding
- Create sample upcoming events
- Ensure events are in user's timezone
- Mix of event types and locations

### 5. Real-time Features
- WebSocket updates for new events
- Live attendee count updates
- Instant RSVP reflection

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate Fix**: Add debug logging and improve empty state messaging
2. **Short Term**: Create sample events and fix filtering logic
3. **Medium Term**: Add flexible filtering options
4. **Long Term**: Implement real-time updates and AI recommendations
