# 40x20s Work Capture Fix - Automatic Daily Activity Logging

## Date: July 23, 2025

### Problem Identified
- Daily activities were failing to save with error: "null value in column 'project_id' violates not-null constraint"
- The client-side `activityLoggingService.ts` was sending field names that didn't match server expectations
- Database was receiving null values for `project_id`, `project_title`, and `activity_type`

### Root Cause Analysis (40x20s Layer 7 - API Integration)
1. **Client-Server Field Mismatch**:
   - Client was sending: `featureId`, `activity` (title)
   - Server expected: `projectId`, `projectName`

2. **Database Schema Requirements**:
   - `project_id`: text NOT NULL
   - `project_title`: text NOT NULL
   - `activity_type`: text NOT NULL
   - `description`: text NOT NULL

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Field Mapping** in `client/src/services/activityLoggingService.ts`:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   featureId: activity.featureId,
   activity: activity.title,
   
   // After:
   projectId: activity.featureId || 'life-ceo-system',
   projectName: activity.title,
   ```

2. **Enhanced Server Route** in `server/routes.ts`:
   - Added proper fallback values for all required fields
   - Improved data mapping to handle both old and new formats

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Added test button to Life CEO Command Center
   - Fixed display to show `project_title` field correctly
   - Integrated with existing query refetch mechanism

### Testing Results
- Manual curl test: ✅ Successfully created activity
- UI test button: ✅ Working with automatic refetch
- Field mapping: ✅ All required fields populated correctly

### 40x20s Methodology Benefits
- Systematic debugging through data flow layers
- Identified exact field mapping issues
- Prevented future errors with proper type safety
- Enhanced with comprehensive logging during debug phase

### Automatic Work Capture Status
✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - All project updates are now automatically captured in daily activities with proper timestamps and Buenos Aires timezone support.
