   - Impact: Better type safety, no performance impact

3. **Image Optimization**: Some images not using next-gen formats
   - Solution: Convert to WebP with fallbacks
   - Expected improvement: -0.2s average

### Medium-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Edge Caching**: Implement Cloudflare Workers
2. **Database Indexes**: Add missing indexes for frequent queries
3. **WebSocket Optimization**: Reduce reconnection attempts
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Further split large chunks

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Progressive Web App**: Full PWA implementation
2. **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider Next.js migration
3. **GraphQL**: Replace REST with GraphQL for efficiency
4. **Microservices**: Split monolith for better scaling
