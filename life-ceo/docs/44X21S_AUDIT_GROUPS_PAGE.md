## Issues Found:

- **Location**: Create Community button, filter buttons
- **Fix**: Replace with turquoise-cyan gradients

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue**: Using plain white cards instead of glassmorphic design
- **Location**: Statistics cards, search container
- **Fix**: Apply glassmorphic styling
- **Status**: Missing MT design elements

### 3. ⚠️ Hard-coded Event Counts
- **Severity**: Low
- **Issue**: Using mock data for event counts
- **Fix**: Integrate with real events API
- **Status**: Functional but not dynamic

## Automations Verified:
- Real-time membership status updates
- Automatic query invalidation after mutations
- Cache busting for fresh data
- Filter state management
- Dynamic city count calculation

## Performance Metrics:
- Initial Load: ~1-2s

- Memory Usage: Low
- Bundle Size: Moderate

## Notes:
- Well-structured component with good functionality

- Missing MT ocean theme is main issue
- Two different card components (EnhancedCityGroupCard, CommunityCard)
- Good error handling and loading states

## Overall Score: 75/100
Solid implementation with comprehensive functionality, but significant deduction for missing MT ocean theme. The purple gradient design doesn't match the platform's turquoise-cyan aesthetic. All features work correctly, TypeScript is clean, and mobile responsiveness is good.
