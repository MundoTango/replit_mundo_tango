- ✅ Glassmorphic cards used throughout
- ✅ Proper hover states and transitions

## Enhanced 44x21s Framework Improvements

### New Verification Checkpoints Added:
1. **Pre-Implementation Design Review**: Verify UI mockups match MT design system
2. **Third-party Integration Checklist**: Ensure all external services are functional
3. **Automated Placeholder Detection**: Search for common placeholder patterns
4. **Visual Regression Testing**: Verify design consistency after changes

### Framework Updates:
- Added Layer 44 (Continuous Validation) for real-time compliance checking
