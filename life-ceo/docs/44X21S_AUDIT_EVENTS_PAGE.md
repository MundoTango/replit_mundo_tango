## Automations Verified:
- Query parameter building for filters
- Form state management
- Media upload handling
- Role assignment system
- Filter persistence

## Performance Metrics:
- Initial Load: Unknown (TypeScript errors)
- Form Complexity: High (20+ fields)
- Filter Response: ~1-2s estimated
- Memory Usage: Medium (complex state)

## Mobile Testing:
- [ ] iPhone Safari - Not tested
- [ ] Android Chrome - Not tested
- [ ] Tablet Portrait - Not tested
- [ ] Tablet Landscape - Not tested

## Notes:
- Extremely feature-rich events system
- Supports ticketing, virtual events, recurring events
- Advanced role assignment capabilities
- TypeScript errors must be fixed immediately
- Needs complete MT ocean theme redesign
- Consider breaking into smaller components

## Overall Score: 50/100
Feature-rich implementation severely hampered by TypeScript errors and missing MT ocean theme. The functionality is comprehensive (ticketing, virtual, recurring events) but the page cannot build successfully. Critical fixes needed for deployment readiness.
