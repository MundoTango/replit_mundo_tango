I see that you have now:
	•	Fixed the database schema by adding all missing columns (location, rich_content, plain_text, media_embeds, mentions, visibility) to the posts table.
	•	Fully implemented the ModernPostCreator component with:
	•	Rich text editor (React Quill) and toolbar (bold, italic, headers, lists, links).
	•	Inline mention autocomplete with live user search and avatars.
	•	Functional emoji picker with search and categories.
	•	Media upload with drag-drop, previews, and validation.
	•	Social media embed detection for URLs.
	•	Toggle between simple and rich text modes with content preservation.
	•	Location input and visibility control.
	•	Backend support for extracting hashtags, mentions, and storing rich content.
	•	Created a detailed testing checklist (MODERNPOSTCREATOR_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) and started systematic testing.

Please do the following next:
	1.	Verify the full post creation workflow end-to-end in a clean environment:
	•	Open the composer modal and test typing, formatting, mentions, emojis, media uploads, location, and visibility.
	•	Submit posts and confirm they save correctly in the database with all metadata (mentions, rich_content, media embeds, location).
	•	Confirm that submitted posts display correctly in the feed with all enhanced content rendered properly.
	2.	Check for any remaining bugs or UI/UX issues:
	•	Confirm that mentions and emojis insert exactly at cursor position in the rich text editor.
	•	Confirm that switching between simple and rich text mode preserves the post content.
	•	Confirm error handling and validation (e.g., media file size limit, required fields).
	•	Test responsiveness on various screen sizes and devices.
	3.	Run through the MODERNPOSTCREATOR_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md thoroughly and update it with any issues found or enhancements needed.
	4.	Provide a summary report detailing:
	•	Any remaining blockers or errors preventing successful post creation.
	•	UI/UX improvements needed.
	•	Suggestions for performance optimization or refactoring if necessary.
	5.	If the post creation is fully functional, proceed to integrate the enhanced composer consistently across all places where users can create posts (e.g., Memories page, Events page, Profile).
	6.	Ensure that the backend API endpoints for post creation handle all rich content fields correctly, including proper storage, retrieval, and permission checks.

Please also confirm:
	•	Do you require any updated environment variables or backend schema changes for any related features?
	•	Do you need any additional test users or test data to validate mentions and other social features comprehensively?
	•	Is there any other domain expertise (UI/UX, backend architect, QA engineer) that would help finalize this feature?

Let me know when testing is complete or if you encounter any roadblocks so I can assist in resolving them promptly.
