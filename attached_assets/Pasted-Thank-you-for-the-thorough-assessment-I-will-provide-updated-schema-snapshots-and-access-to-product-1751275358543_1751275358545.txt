Thank you for the thorough assessment. I will provide updated schema snapshots and access to production data for your reference. Please let me know if you require any additional information, database credentials, or access permissions to proceed effectively.

Here are clarifications and next steps based on your detailed assessment:
	1.	Database Schema Alignment:
	•	There is some schema drift, particularly with the event_rsvps table and enhanced tables such as media_tags, event_invitations, and user_followed_cities. Please verify the actual production database schema fully before proceeding.
	•	Use the latest schema snapshots and ensure compatibility with the deployed database.
	2.	Environment Configuration:
	•	Supabase credentials and project environment variables are partially configured but need validation.
	•	External integrations (Resend email, Plausible analytics, Supabase Storage) are operational but require continuous monitoring.
	3.	Feature Status and Priorities:
	•	Some UI redesigns, e.g., Moments page, are approved and implemented; others remain experimental.
	•	Highest priority: stabilize database schema and core backend APIs.
	•	Medium priority: complete media tagging, event roles, and followed cities features.
	•	Lower priority: large-scale UI redesign and real-time features expansion.
	4.	Workflow Optimizations - Schema-First Development Approach:
	•	Schema Verification: Always verify current production database schema before implementing new features to avoid drift.
	•	Migration Scripts: Use version-controlled SQL or ORM-based migration scripts; avoid manual production schema changes.
	•	Incremental Testing: After schema updates, individually test database queries and API endpoints before frontend integration.
	•	Continuous Synchronization: Keep documentation (e.g., replit.md) current with actual deployed schemas and API contracts.
	•	Rollback Strategy: Implement and test rollback scripts to mitigate deployment risks.
	•	Feature Flags: Wrap experimental features with feature flags to allow safe incremental rollout and debugging.
This approach ensures stability, reduces errors from schema mismatches, and improves reliability during incremental feature development.
	5.	Immediate Next Steps:
	•	Fix database schema errors and align expectations with actual deployed state.
	•	Create comprehensive test data matching the real schema.
	•	Establish a stable baseline before integrating prioritized features incrementally.

Finally, do you require expertise from other domains—such as database architects, UI/UX designers, or security specialists—to help improve efficiency or address specific challenges encountered during the project? Please advise so we can coordinate necessary support.

Looking forward to your confirmation and guidance on next steps.
