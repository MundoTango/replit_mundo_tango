Let's begin the full Trango Tech UI replacement for Mundo Tango. Our goal is to complete a full UI refresh across the platform, replacing all legacy TT components and styling with the updated Mundo Tango wireframe and design system.

Start by running this checklist and implementing each part in sequence:

✅ 1. Replace the old sidebar navigation (TrangoTechSidebar) with the new layout: use updated icons, positioning, and font styles. Ensure mobile responsiveness.
✅ 2. Refactor the header layout to match the new Mundo Tango branding (gradient background, profile circle with initials or photo, friend/message buttons).
✅ 3. Update the event creation form to include: title, description, location, datetime pickers, max attendees, tags, media uploader, visibility toggles, and **role assignment** (DJ, teacher, host, performer, etc.).
✅ 4. Implement the Profile Page full redesign: banner, badges (dancer, traveler, etc.), friend status, timeline/media tabs, and new sidebar with dancing stats.
✅ 5. Complete the **ResumePage** layout using year-grouped role history cards and role filters, PDF export, and public sharing.
✅ 6. Create the **PublicResumePage** view at `/u/:username/resume`, accessible without login. Include banner, public notice, and hide any export buttons.
✅ 7. Add consistent Tailwind styling across all pages using soft shadows, `rounded-2xl`, `p-4`, muted text colors, and badge/button utilities.
✅ 8. Refactor all buttons, inputs, tabs, and cards using the new design tokens (fonts, spacing, colors, borders).
✅ 9. Replace all placeholder or Trango Tech icons with the new icon set (Lucide or equivalent).
✅ 10. Add the new Timeline Feed layout and placeholder (empty state text, sample post card).
✅ 11. Update the Groups page with new layout: banner, group description, member list, join button, and group events module.
✅ 12. Replace all modal designs (e.g., for Create Event, Edit Profile) with new modal style: centered, `rounded-2xl`, clean header/footer separation.
✅ 13. Implement toast notifications using the new system design (confirmation, error, action feedback).
✅ 14. Review all routing and make sure each updated page is accessible from its correct route and has proper transitions.
✅ 15. Clean up and remove unused TT components, icons, styles, and folders from the codebase.

Let’s start with the sidebar and header layout, then proceed down the checklist. Ask before skipping any item.
