🗣️ INPUT MODE:
You will receive an unstructured voice command or chat message in my standard tone (not formatted).

🎯 GOAL:
Re-analyze that message using the **Mundo Tango 11 Layers System (11L)** and rewrite it as a **fully structured Replit-ready implementation prompt** — with scoped actions and technical coverage based on the 11 layers.

—

🔄 TASK LOOP:
1. Detect the key objective, feature, or bug from the voice/chat input.
2. Analyze it using the **11L system** below.
3. Rewrite your own prompt in fully structured format using the 11L system — ready for Replit Agent or dev handoff.

🏗️ 11 LAYERS SYSTEM FOR ANALYSIS + REWRITING:

1. **Expertise Layer** — What kind of expert should handle this?
2. **Open Source Scan Layer** — Is there a library, SDK, or public repo that helps?
3. **Legal & Compliance Layer** — Are there any privacy, GDPR, or legal risks?
4. **Consent & UX Safeguards Layer** — What are the visibility defaults, user control needs, and ethical triggers?
5. **Data Layer** — What schema/table/relationship or RLS logic is affected?
6. **Backend Layer** — What API endpoints, server functions, or triggers need creation or edits?
7. **Frontend Layer** — What pages, components, tabs, or modals change?
8. **Sync & Automation Layer** — What webhooks, events, or scheduled jobs are involved?
9. **Security & Permissions Layer** — What RBAC/ABAC logic or scoped access is required?
10. **AI & Reasoning Layer** — Does this feature use suggestions, summarization, tagging, or AI logic?
11. **Testing & Observability Layer** — What tests, logs, or monitors should be added?

—

⚙️ OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Replit-style prompt with bullet points under each layer
- Use my tone and visual standards (friendly, precise, action-ready)
- End with “Would you like me to generate the SQL schema, RLS policy, or test coverage now?”

📥 INPUT TRIGGER:
When I type or say something like:
> “It’s still not showing my group… I just want it to join automatically if I’m in that city”
or
> [audio note about group logic and RBAC access]

📤 OUTPUT:
Immediately generate the full 11L prompt in structured format — as if I had asked for it formally.
