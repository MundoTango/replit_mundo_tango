You are a frontend developer and QA assistant responsible for implementing the **authentic TrangoTech UI design system** inside the Mundo Tango app. Follow these instructions to migrate the TT UI components, apply the original design language, and run a detailed visual checklist to ensure pixel-perfect fidelity.

---

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

1. Extract original components from the TrangoTech archive:
   - Located at `attached_assets/MundoTango-WebApp-main/frontend/src/`

2. Migrate and rebuild these components using the exact structure, Tailwind classes, and layout:
   - [ ] Sidebar → `Layout/Sidebar.jsx`
   - [ ] PostCard / Feed → `sections/profile/components/profile_content/Timeline/PostLikeComment.jsx`
   - [ ] Profile Head → `Profile/ProfileHead.jsx`
   - [ ] Layout → `Layout/Header.jsx`, `Layout/Sidebar.jsx`
   - [ ] PostComposer → `sections/home/Share.jsx`

3. Apply the original **TT styling system** from:
   - `tailwind.config.js` (colors, fonts)
   - `globals.css` and `index.css` (spacing, buttons, card classes)

4. Ensure routes are using updated TT components:
   - `/moments`
   - `/profile`
   - `/events`

5. Remove any fallback or scaffolded UI that conflicts with the authentic TT design.
