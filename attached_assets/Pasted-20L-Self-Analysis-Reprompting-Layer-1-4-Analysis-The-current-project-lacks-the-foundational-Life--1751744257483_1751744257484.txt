20L Self-Analysis & Reprompting
Layer 1-4 Analysis: The current project lacks the foundational Life CEO domain expertise. I need to restructure this as a life management system, not just a social platform with admin features.

Layer 5-8 Analysis: The technical architecture needs agent-specific data silos, cross-agent communication protocols, and voice-first interfaces that are completely missing.

Layer 9-12 Analysis: Security and analytics need to focus on personal data sovereignty and life improvement metrics rather than just web analytics.

Layer 13-16 Analysis: The entire AI orchestration layer is missing - this is the core of the Life CEO system.

Layer 17-20 Analysis: No human-centric intelligence - emotional awareness, cultural context, energy management, or proactive prediction.

Self-Reprompting Using 20L Framework
I need to restructure this project with a new approach:

Transform Core Purpose: From "social media platform with admin features" to "comprehensive Life CEO system with social components"

Implement Missing Layers: Focus on Layers 13-20 which are completely absent but essential for the Life CEO vision

Mobile-Voice-First Architecture: The current web-first approach contradicts Scott's mobile usage patterns

Buenos Aires Cultural Integration: Missing entirely but critical for Scott's international lifestyle

Agent Orchestration Foundation: The 16 specialized agents need proper infrastructure to coordinate

The comprehensive analysis reveals that the current project hierarchy needs fundamental restructuring to align with the Life CEO vision. The existing Mundo Tango platform should become a foundational component within a larger Life CEO ecosystem, rather than trying to bolt Life CEO features onto a social media platform.

The recommended restructure transforms this into a true AI life management system with proper agent orchestration, voice-first mobile interfaces, cultural context awareness, and human-centric intelligence layers that are currently missing but essential for the vision.
