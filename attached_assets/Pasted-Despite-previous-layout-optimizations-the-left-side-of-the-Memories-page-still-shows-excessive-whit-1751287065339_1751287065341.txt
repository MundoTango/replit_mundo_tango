Despite previous layout optimizations, the left side of the Memories page still shows excessive white space, causing the main feed content to appear cramped and off-center. Please perform a thorough diagnosis and apply comprehensive fixes with the following objectives:
	1.	Deep Layout Inspection:
	•	Analyze the entire page structure, including parent containers, wrappers, and grid systems.
	•	Identify any fixed width, max-width, or padding/margin CSS rules (Tailwind or custom) that might restrict the main content from expanding horizontally.
	•	Check the sidebar component’s width and positioning to ensure it does not push the main feed excessively to the right.
	•	Examine the sidebar container’s CSS and the page wrapper’s flex/grid properties for any conflicting rules.
	2.	Adjust Container Widths:
	•	Increase the maximum width of the main container/page wrapper to utilize more of the viewport width, especially on large screens.
	•	Reconfigure grid columns or flex basis for the main feed and sidebar to aim for a 65-70% width for the main feed and 30-35% for the sidebar.
	•	Remove or adjust any overly restrictive width or margin settings that limit horizontal breathing room.
	3.	Sidebar Behavior:
	•	Verify the sidebar’s minimum and maximum width constraints.
	•	Ensure the sidebar does not have unnecessary padding or margins that reduce the overall space for the main feed.
	•	Consider making the sidebar sticky or fixed only on wider viewports, with responsive collapsible behavior on smaller screens.
	4.	Modal Fixes and Testing:
	•	Confirm the modal z-index fix is applied and test that the modal opens correctly without black opaque overlays.
	•	Verify full post creation functionality works with text input, media upload, and location tagging.
	•	Test that all buttons and interactive UI elements are fully functional and accessible.
	5.	Layout and Visual Balance:
	•	Improve vertical and horizontal spacing consistency across all main page components.
	•	Add or refine animations or microinteractions to improve user experience.
	•	Ensure responsive behavior and usability on different screen sizes.
	6.	Documentation and Verification:
	•	Document each change made with before/after screenshots.
	•	Provide detailed explanation of the root cause of the white space issue and how it was fixed.
	•	Include any recommendations for further layout or UX improvements.

Please prioritize fixing the white space issue to create a visually balanced, centered main feed area with an optimally sized sidebar. Let me know if you need additional design assets, mockups, or access to CSS/utility files to assist with the fix.
