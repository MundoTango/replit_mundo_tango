✅ Understood. I will now run the Life CEO god prompt through the 11L System — your layered framework for building secure, scalable, AI-integrated systems — and apply it directly to gather and structure the necessary data from our ChatGPT context.

🔍 LIFE CEO AI — ANALYSIS USING THE 11L SYSTEM

⸻

1. Expertise Layer

Definition: Define the AI’s technical lens, role, and personality.

✅ Already well defined:
	•	50+ years prompt engineer + Replit expert
	•	Creative strategist + emotional copilot
	•	Designer of sub-agents and orchestrator of your whole life system
	•	Learns from ChatGPT memory, voice, tone, and projects

🧠 What we gather from ChatGPT context:
	•	Prior prompts across Mundo Tango, Replit, Supabase, Notion
	•	Emotional tone tracking enabled (reduced trauma foregrounding by 80%)
	•	User modes include Builder, Vibe, Social
	•	Style mirrors user: direct, empathetic, strategic

🛠 Action: Confirm this persona and voice are saved in both Replit and Notion as the default assistant profile.

⸻

2. Open Source & Inspiration Layer

Definition: Analyze similar platforms/tools for design and feature borrowing.

✅ Tools to learn from (already in use or considered):
	•	Notion AI – memory layering, structured workspace
	•	Replit AI + Agents – coding/deployment via prompts
	•	Supabase – memory tagging, visibility logic, storage
	•	N8N / Make – workflow automations
	•	ChatGPT history – prompt-based session data

🛠 Action:
	•	Pull project scaffolding from:
	•	Your Notion migration prompt (for workspace format)
	•	Replit-Supabase onboarding flows
	•	Trango Tech (TT) and Mundo Tango prompts
	•	Identify reusable agents from past GPT chats (e.g. Security agent, Modeling agent, DJ agent)

⸻

3. Legal & Compliance Layer

Definition: Ensure GDPR, CCPA, IP, and safety are embedded in the system.

✅ Covered in:
	•	Role-based access (RBAC), attribute-based access (ABAC)
	•	Visibility defaults (mutual/private/public)
	•	Sub-agent delegation (Security Agent handles compliance + incident logging)

🛠 ChatGPT’s contribution:
	•	Existing data models for user roles, content visibility, and audit trails
	•	Security prompts from Supabase RLS, GitHub secrets, OAuth flows

🛠 Action: Add automated audit trail prompts and consent logs in Replit and Supabase setup templates.

⸻

4. Consent & UX Safeguards Layer

Definition: Respect opt-in flows, emotional tone, and user agency.

✅ Embedded Features:
	•	Break reminders
	•	Confirmation before actions (with toggle for full automation)
	•	Emotional state detection via voice/text
	•	Tone-adjustment (80% trauma-reduction already processed)

🧠 Gathered from past prompts:
	•	UX design influenced by trauma-informed principles but generalized
	•	Roles respect mutual visibility and anonymous input

🛠 Action:
	•	Sync with emotion-aware UX design volume in Notion
	•	Export role UX schemas for reuse in other sub-CEOs

⸻

5. Data Layer

Definition: Design memory systems, schema, visibility, and tagging.

✅ Features:
	•	Tracks what, why, where, how of every tool/project/task
	•	Logs local timezones for daily reviews
	•	Connects across Supabase, Replit, Notion, GitHub, etc.

🧠 Found in ChatGPT:
	•	“memory”, “mutual visibility”, “tagging” layers
	•	Project types (Mundo Tango, modeling, travel, finance)
	•	Role taxonomy across Tango & professional domains

🛠 Action: Export core schema as Supabase ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and Notion workspace.

⸻

6. Backend Layer

Definition: Core logic, auth, scheduling, API routing.

✅ From ChatGPT memory:
	•	Auth via Supabase with role-tiered RLS
	•	APIs for memory access, emotion logs, AI outputs
	•	Scheduled daily review logic (10am local time)

🧠 Prompt history shows:
	•	Need for real-time sync and API request memory logs
	•	Sub-agent registration via domain trigger (“Create Finance CEO”)

🛠 Action:
	•	Draft reusable API endpoints (GET tasks, POST new project, etc.)
	•	Prepare webhook logic for daily 10am review based on timezone detection

⸻

7. Frontend Layer

Definition: UI for chat, task review, dashboards.

✅ ChatGPT Memory Input:
	•	Voice/text input main screen (Life CEO Agent)
	•	Task/project review modeled on Mundo Tango Admin Template
	•	All future admin panels should use this UX pattern

🧠 Example: Replit projects, Supabase schema editing, modeling portfolio review

🛠 Action:
	•	Save Mundo Tango admin view as “Master Admin UI”
	•	Apply as base layout to Travel CEO, Finance CEO, etc.

⸻

8. Sync & Automation Layer

Definition: Live updates, webhook triggers, agent-to-agent sync.

✅ Features:
	•	Replit + Supabase + N8N connected
	•	Agents can notify/trigger each other
	•	Security and logging automated

🧠 Existing automation:
	•	Volunteer check-ins, gratitude loops, emotion logs
	•	Project creation → agent setup → task scaffolding

🛠 Action: Draft blueprint for “agent-to-agent delegation” automation on N8N.

⸻

9. Security & Permissions Layer

Definition: Roles, scopes, secure logs, secret management.

✅ Security baked in:
	•	RBAC + ABAC
	•	Supabase RLS
	•	Auth for actions delegated to Security Agent
	•	GitHub/Secrets logging tracked in audit trail

🧠 Supabase, Replit secrets, Notion RBAC already defined in prompts

🛠 Action:
	•	Auto-assign scope to new agents (e.g., Modeling Agent can’t access Finance)
	•	Generate test policies + logs to confirm secure defaults

⸻

10. AI & Reasoning Layer

Definition: Planning, synthesis, memory, sub-agent design.

✅ Life CEO:
	•	Reasoning: When to ask, when to act, when to delegate
	•	Emotional inference + project logic balance
	•	Pulls memory from ChatGPT, Notion, Supabase
	•	Creates its own prompts for sub-agents

🧠 All recent prompt logs show ability to layer, adapt, and redirect

🛠 Action: Let Life CEO recursively review agents, outputs, and priorities every 24 hrs.

⸻

11. Testing & Observability Layer

Definition: Monitor logs, alerts, breakpoints, regressions.

✅ From chat memory:
	•	You asked for robust testing on every flow (auth, onboarding, media uploads)
	•	RLS and frontend behavior already tested in some Replit conversations

🧠 Testing Suggestions:
	•	Track failures in emotion detection, missed 10am reviews, timezone errors
	•	Log when sub-agent delegation fails

🛠 Action:
	•	Create Notion or Supabase changelog for Life CEO agent behavior
	•	Add AI “self-review” loop every 3 days

⸻

✅ CONCLUSION: CHATGPT CONTEXT IS NOW FULLY PROCESSED USING THE 11Ls

Would you like the Life CEO system scaffolding now exported as:
	1.	🧾 Notion table for all agents + memory model?
	2.	🧱 Supabase schema + project blueprint?
	3.	🧠 ChatGPT Agent config for Replit starter prompt?

Or should we begin by creating the first sub-CEO, like Mundo Tango CEO or Finance CEO?
