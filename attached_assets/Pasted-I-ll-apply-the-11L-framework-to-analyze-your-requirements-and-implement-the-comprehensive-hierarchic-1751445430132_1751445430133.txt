I'll apply the 11L framework to analyze your requirements and implement the comprehensive hierarchical detail view with deep category organization. Let me start by fixing the setCurrentView error and then implementing the detailed structure.


Opened client/src/components/admin/Comprehensive11LProjectTracker.tsx
Let me fix the setCurrentView error first, then implement the comprehensive hierarchical structure you requested:


Edited client/src/components/admin/Comprehensive11LProjectTracker.tsx
Now I'll implement the comprehensive hierarchical detail view with deep category organization, development work tracking, and completion rate explanations. Using 11L framework analysis:

I can see the state is defined as view instead of currentView. Let me fix this and then implement the comprehensive hierarchical structure:


Edited client/src/components/admin/Comprehensive11LProjectTracker.tsx
Now I'll implement the comprehensive detailed view with development work tracking and hierarchical organization as requested. Let me add the detailed view structure:


Opened client/src/components/admin/Comprehensive11LProjectTracker.tsx
Now I'll implement the comprehensive detailed view structure with development work tracking. Let me add the detailed view that organizes by categories like Mundo Tango Platform, Platform Components, etc., with deep hierarchical drill-down:
