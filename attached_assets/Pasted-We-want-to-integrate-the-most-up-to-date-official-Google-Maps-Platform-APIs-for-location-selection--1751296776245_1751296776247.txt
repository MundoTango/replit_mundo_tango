We want to integrate the most up-to-date, official Google Maps Platform APIs for location selection and autocomplete everywhere in Mundo Tango where users input location data, such as:
	•	Post creation (location tagging in posts)
	•	User registration/profile (home city, dance locations)
	•	Event creation and editing (event venues, cities, countries)
	•	Any other feature involving city, state, or address input

Requirements:
	1.	Use the official Google Maps JavaScript API with Places library to enable:
	•	Autocomplete address/city/state search with suggestions
	•	Selection of locations with latitude/longitude data
	•	Map-based location picker with draggable markers where appropriate (e.g., event venues)
	2.	Ensure seamless integration with existing UI components in these modules:
	•	client/src/components/moments/EnhancedPostComposer.tsx (post location input)
	•	client/src/pages/register.tsx or equivalent user registration/profile components
	•	client/src/pages/events.tsx and client/src/components/events/EventForm.tsx
	•	Any other location inputs found in TT files or current codebase (please audit and list all relevant files/components)
	3.	Add Google Maps API keys securely to the Replit secrets environment, ensuring keys are not hardcoded.
	4.	Use consistent UX patterns for location input:
	•	Autocomplete dropdown with real-time suggestions as user types
	•	Ability to select from dropdown and populate location fields (city, state, country, lat/lng)
	•	Map preview where applicable with draggable marker to fine-tune location
	5.	Validate and sanitize all location data before saving to the database, storing:
	•	Standardized city, state, and country names
	•	Coordinates (latitude, longitude)
	•	Formatted address string
	6.	Update backend API endpoints as necessary to support richer location data in create and update workflows.
	7.	Audit all TT files and current codebase to identify every location-related form or input. Provide a comprehensive list of affected components/modules and confirm the integration coverage.

Deliverables:
	•	Updated React components with Google Maps Places Autocomplete and/or Map Picker integrated in all location fields
	•	Securely stored API keys in Replit environment secrets
	•	Backend support for enhanced location data (if needed)
	•	Comprehensive report listing all location input points updated, with before/after screenshots or demos
	•	Recommendations for any UI/UX improvements to location input workflows based on Google Maps best practices

⸻

Additional notes:
	•	Use official Google Maps JavaScript API with Places library
	•	Use environment variables for all API keys
	•	Adhere to Google Maps usage quotas and billing best practices
	•	Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness of location inputs
