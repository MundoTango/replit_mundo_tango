- Target: 100% coverage

### üîß Test Utilities to Create

1. **Test Factories**
   ```typescript
   // tests/factories/userFactory.ts
   export const createTestUser = (overrides = {})
   export const createTestPost = (userId, overrides = {})
   export const createTestEvent = (overrides = {})
   ```

2. **Test Helpers**
   ```typescript
   // tests/helpers/auth.ts
   export const authenticateTestUser = async ()
   export const createAuthHeaders = (token)
   ```

3. **Mock Utilities**
   ```typescript
   // tests/mocks/stripe.ts
   export const mockStripeCustomer = ()
   export const mockPaymentIntent = ()
   ```
