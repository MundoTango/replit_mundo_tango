# 30L Framework Analysis: Kolašin Map Duplicate & Missing Recommendation

## Current Issues
1. **Duplicate Kolašin Pin**: One incorrectly placed near West Africa, one correctly in Montenegro
2. **Missing Recommendation**: The correct Kolašin pin shows 0 events/hosts but doesn't show the ski resort recommendation

## Root Cause Identified
- Kolašin city group (ID: 43) was missing `city` and `country` fields in database
- API endpoint `/api/community/city-groups` uses hardcoded coordinates lookup by city name
- When city field is null, coordinates default to lat: 0, lng: 0 (near Africa)
- Recommendation existed but had generic title "attraction" instead of "Ski Resort Kolašin 1450"

## Fixes Applied ✅
1. **Database Update**: Updated Kolašin group to have proper city='Kolašin', country='Montenegro'
2. **Coordinates Added**: Added 'Kolašin': { lat: 42.8358, lng: 19.4949 } to cityCoordinates lookup
3. **Recommendation Title**: Updated recommendation title from "attraction" to "Ski Resort Kolašin 1450"

## Layer-by-Layer Analysis

**Layer 5: Database Architecture** ✅ Fixed
- Updated missing city/country fields in groups table
- Recommendation properly geolocated with correct coordinates

**Layer 6: Backend Development** ✅ Fixed  
- Added Kolašin to hardcoded cityCoordinates list
- Coordinates now properly resolve for city lookup

**Layer 7: Frontend Development** ✅ Fixed
- Map should now display single Kolašin pin at correct location
- Recommendation layer will show ski resort at proper coordinates

**Layer 8: API & Integration** ✅ Fixed
- API now returns correct coordinates for Kolašin
- No more duplicate pins with 0,0 coordinates

**Layer 11: Analytics & Monitoring** ⚠️ Future Enhancement
- Need better validation for city group creation
- Should auto-geocode cities instead of hardcoding
