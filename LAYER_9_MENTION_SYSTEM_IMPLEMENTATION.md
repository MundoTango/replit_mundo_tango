- **Data Structure**: Returns structured JSON with users, events, groups arrays
- **Security**: Authenticated endpoint with user context validation

#### Memory Creation with Mentions
```typescript
POST /api/memory/create-with-mentions
```
- **Functionality**: Creates memories with embedded mention metadata
- **Mention Parsing**: Regex-based extraction of @[Display](type:user,id:123) format
- **Notification System**: Automatic notification delivery to mentioned users
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of mention creation and notifications

### 2. Frontend Components ✅

### 4. Notification System ✅

#### Automatic Notification Delivery
- **Trigger**: Memory creation with user mentions
- **Recipients**: All mentioned users (excluding memory creator)
- **Content**: Personalized notification with memory title and creator name
- **Delivery**: Real-time insertion into notifications table

#### Notification Structure
```typescript
{
  user_id: mentionedUserId,
  type: 'memory_mention',
  title: 'You were mentioned in a memory',
  message: 'Scott Boddye mentioned you in "Tango Workshop at Studio"',
  data: {
    memoryId: memory.id,
    creatorName: 'Scott Boddye',
    memoryTitle: 'Tango Workshop at Studio'
  }
}
```

```

### Backend Architecture
```typescript
// API Endpoints
server/routes.ts (lines 4665-4806)
- GET /api/search/mentions: User/event search
- POST /api/memory/create-with-mentions: Memory creation with mentions

// Database Integration
- PostgreSQL JSONB storage for mention metadata
- Indexed queries for optimal search performance
- Notification table integration for mention alerts
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Memory mentions storage
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN mentions JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Mention search indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_mentions ON memories USING GIN(mentions);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_search ON users (name, username);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_search ON events (title);
```
