## Recommended Execution Order

### Week 1: Documentation Blitz
- Focus: API docs + developer guides
- Target: 50% documentation coverage
- Resources: 2-3 days intensive documentation

### Week 2: CI/CD Foundation
- Focus: Test automation + deployment pipeline
- Target: Automated testing on all PRs
- Resources: GitHub Actions setup

### Week 3: Performance Sprint
- Focus: Database + frontend optimization
- Target: 50% performance improvement
- Resources: Performance profiling tools

### Week 4: Monitoring Implementation
- Focus: APM + business metrics
- Target: Full visibility into system health
- Resources: Sentry + custom dashboards

## Success Metrics
1. **Documentation**: 80% coverage by end of month
2. **CI/CD**: Zero manual deployments
3. **Performance**: <2s average page load
4. **Monitoring**: 99.9% uptime visibility
5. **Features**: All P0-P1 features complete

## Risk Mitigation
- **Documentation Debt**: Assign dedicated time blocks
- **CI/CD Complexity**: Start with simple pipelines
- **Performance Regression**: Implement performance budgets
- **Feature Creep**: Strict prioritization framework

## Next Immediate Action
Based on criticality and impact, recommend starting with:
1. **API Documentation** (enables external integrations)
2. **CI/CD Setup** (prevents regression)
3. **Performance Profiling** (identifies bottlenecks)
