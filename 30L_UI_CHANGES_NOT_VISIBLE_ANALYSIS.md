# 30L Framework Analysis: UI Changes Not Visible

## Issue Summary
User reports that changes made to the system are not visible in the UI, specifically:
1. Map centering on Kola≈°in
2. Recommendation count display
3. Memory-based recommendations

## Layer-by-Layer Analysis

### Layer 1: Expertise & Technical Proficiency ‚úì
- Changes made correctly to backend and frontend code
- Proper understanding of React component props and API integration

### Layer 2: Research & Discovery ‚úì
- Identified correct issues: missing coordinates, wrong recommendation count query
- Found Kola≈°in slug is "kola-in-montenegro" not "kolasin"

### Layer 3: Legal & Compliance ‚úì
- No legal issues

### Layer 4: UX/UI Design üîç
- Need to verify UI components are receiving updated props
- Check if map is actually using the centerLat/centerLng props

### Layer 5: Database Architecture ‚úì
- Recommendation count query fixed to not require postId
- Coordinates added to city mapping

### Layer 6: Backend Development ‚úì
- API endpoints updated correctly
- Recommendation count now includes all active recommendations

### Layer 7: Frontend Development üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Issue**: GroupDetailPageMT may not be passing centerLat/centerLng to CommunityMapWithLayers
- **Issue**: Recommendation count may not be displayed in UI

### Layer 8: API & Integration ‚úì
- APIs returning correct data (confirmed via curl)

### Layer 9: Security & Authentication ‚úì
- Authentication working properly

### Layer 10: Deployment & Infrastructure ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: HMR (Hot Module Replacement) may not be updating components
- **Issue**: Browser cache may be showing old version

### Layer 11: Analytics & Monitoring ‚úì
- Console logs show data is being fetched

### Layer 12: Continuous Improvement üîç
- Need to add better debugging for prop passing

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in Layer 7 (Frontend) where:
1. GroupDetailPageMT isn't passing the center coordinates to CommunityMapWithLayers
2. The recommendation count isn't being displayed in the UI

## Immediate Actions

1. Check if GroupDetailPageMT is passing centerLat/centerLng props
2. Verify recommendation count is displayed in city group statistics
3. Force refresh the page to clear any cache issues
