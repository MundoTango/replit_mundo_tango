# 35L Framework: Profile Page Phases 6-10 - Advanced Integration & Quality Assurance Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the advanced phases (6-10) for the Mundo Tango profile page, focusing on deep platform integration, comprehensive testing, and production excellence using the 35L framework.

## Phase 6: Platform Integration & Data Consistency (Layers 8, 11, 14)

### Objectives:
- Ensure 100% integration with existing platform features
- Implement intelligent data connections and autocomplete
- Fix all broken functionality from previous phases

### Key Implementations:

#### 1. Profile Photo Upload Integration
- **Current Issue**: Upload mutations exist but may not be properly connected to backend
- **Solution**:
  - Verify `/api/user/profile-image` and `/api/user/cover-image` endpoints exist
  - Implement proper multipart/form-data handling
  - Add progress indicators and error handling
  - Integrate with Supabase storage if needed
  - Add image preview before upload
  - Implement image cropping/resizing

#### 2. Travel Module Platform Integration
- **Event Field Enhancement**:
  - Replace plain text input with platform event autocomplete
  - Query `/api/events` with typeahead search
  - Display event details (date, location, type) in suggestions
  - Allow creating new events inline if not found
  - Store event ID reference for data consistency
  
- **City Field Enhancement**:
  - Replace plain text with City Groups autocomplete
  - Query `/api/groups` filtered by type='city'
  - Fallback to OpenStreetMap Nominatim for new cities
  - Auto-create City Group if doesn't exist
  - Display member count in suggestions

#### 3. Cross-Feature Data Consistency
- Link travel details to actual platform events
- Ensure city references use consistent City Group IDs
- Connect profile locations to City Groups
- Sync guest profile travel preferences with travel details

### Technical Tasks:
```typescript
// Event Autocomplete Component
- EventAutocomplete.tsx with debounced search
- Platform event type definitions
- Event creation modal integration

// City Autocomplete Component  
- CityGroupAutocomplete.tsx
- Fallback geocoding service
- Auto-creation logic for new cities

// API Enhancements
- GET /api/events/search?q={query}
- GET /api/groups/cities/search?q={query}
- POST /api/groups/cities/auto-create
```
