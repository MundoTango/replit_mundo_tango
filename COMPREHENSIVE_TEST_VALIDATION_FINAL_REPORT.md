### User Session Validation
- **Active User**: Scott Boddye (ID: 3)
- **Roles**: super_admin, admin, dancer, teacher, organizer
- **Authentication Status**: Verified and operational
- **Session Persistence**: Working correctly

### Database Performance
```sql
Key Tables Status:
- events: 20+ columns with location data
- users: Complete profile management
- posts: Enhanced content system
- media_assets: Tagging infrastructure
```

## Testing Infrastructure Status
