// Public endpoint accessible during onboarding
app.get('/api/roles/community', async (req, res) => {
  // No authentication required - accessible during onboarding
  const communityRoles = await db.select(...)
  .from(roles)
  .where(eq(roles.is_platform_role, false));
});

// Authentication middleware applied AFTER public endpoints
app.use('/api', setUserContext);
