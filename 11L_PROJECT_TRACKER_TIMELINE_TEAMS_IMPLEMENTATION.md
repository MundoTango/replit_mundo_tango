# 11L Project Tracker: Timeline and Teams Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of comprehensive Timeline and Teams functionality for the 11L Project Tracker, featuring true hierarchical nested design with Jira-style detailed item views and granular project tracking using the 11L methodology.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Timeline View Implementation
- **Visual Timeline Connector**: Professional gradient timeline with phase dots and hover animations
- **5 Development Phases**: Foundation (100%), Core Features (95%), Advanced Intelligence (75%), Enterprise (80%), Current 11L Tracker work
- **Milestone Tracking**: Detailed phase cards with completion status and future planning
- **Current Phase Highlighting**: Animated pulsing badge for active development phase

### 2. Teams Management View
- **4 Comprehensive Team Cards**: 
  - Core Development Team (Scott Boddye - Lead)
  - Architecture & Strategy Team 
  - UI/UX Design Team
  - Testing & QA Team
- **Team Performance Summary**: 4 active teams, 28 completed projects, 85% overall progress, 340h invested
- **Click-through Capabilities**: All team cards open detailed Jira-style modal views

### 3. Enhanced Hierarchical Structure
- **6-Level Hierarchy**: Platform → Section → Feature → Project → Task → Sub-task breakdown
- **Granular Project Tracking**: Current Timeline and Teams implementation with detailed sub-components
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Team information, original TT files, change documentation, time tracking
