[Abbreviated for focus on immediate issues]

## Action Plan

### 1. Fix Recommendation Display Logic
- Filter recommendations to only show those with actual user posts
- Link recommendations to their source posts/memories
- Display review content from the post

### 2. Implement Button Handlers
- Add click handlers for "View on Map"
- Add click handlers for "Get Directions"
- Ensure proper navigation/window opening

### 3. Fix Map Focus
- City group maps should center on the city
- Set appropriate zoom level (13-14 for city view)
- Fix Buenos Aires coordinates (currently showing in Africa)

### 4. Data Integrity
- Validate all coordinate data
- Ensure recommendations have proper user attribution
- Link reviews to original posts

## Implementation Priority
1. Fix Buenos Aires coordinates (Critical - wrong continent!)
2. Filter recommendations by actual user posts
3. Implement button click handlers
4. Fix map zoom/center for city groups
5. Display actual review content from posts
