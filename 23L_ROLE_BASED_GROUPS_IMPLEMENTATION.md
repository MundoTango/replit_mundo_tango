# 23L Framework Analysis: Role-Based Groups Implementation

## Current Issue
Groups page displaying wrong content (statistics from community-world-map component) instead of actual group cards.

## Layer Analysis

### Layer 1: Expertise (Frontend React Issue)
- Component rendering incorrect content
- Possible import/export mismatch
- Cache serving outdated component

### Layer 5: Data Architecture 
- API returning correct data: `{"success":true,"data":[{"id":32,"name":"Tango Buenos Aires, Argentina"...}]}`
- Database structure supports role-based groups with type field

### Layer 7: Frontend Development
- Groups.tsx component structure appears correct
- EnhancedGroupCard component defined properly
- Issue: Wrong component being rendered at runtime

### Layer 8: API Integration
- `/api/groups` endpoint working correctly
- Returns proper group data with membership status

### Layer 21: Production Resilience
- Cache version mismatch detected (v4 vs v5)
- Service worker in self-destruct mode causing issues
- CacheUpdateNotifier component alerting users

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Service worker was disabled in self-destruct mode
2. Browser serving cached version of wrong component
3. Cache version v4 contained old UI mapping

## Solution Implementation
1. ✅ Updated cache version from v4 to v5
2. ✅ Re-enabled service worker with proper caching
3. ⏳ Verifying Groups page displays correct content

## Role-Based Groups Requirements
- Restructure from city-based to role-based groups
- Example groups: "Milonga Organizers Network", "Tango Teachers Guild"
- Auto-populate based on user's "What do you do in Tango" registration selections
- Maintain existing join/leave/follow functionality

## Next Steps
1. Verify Groups page displays EnhancedGroupCard components
2. Implement role-based group creation logic
3. Create auto-population system based on user roles
4. Update group types from 'city' to role-based categories
