- **Purpose**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/`
- **Configuration**: `cypress.config.ts`
- **Coverage**: Authentication flows, post creation, event management, navigation

#### Playwright (Cross-Browser)
- **Purpose**: Multi-browser automated testing
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/`
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers

### 2. Backend/API Testing

#### Supertest Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: API endpoint testing with Express server
- **Location**: `tests/backend/api/`
- **Coverage**: Authentication, CRUD operations, validation, error handling

#### Newman (Postman Automation)
- **Purpose**: API contract testing and documentation validation
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipeline for automated API testing

### 3. Database Testing

#### pg-mem (In-Memory PostgreSQL)
- **Purpose**: Fast isolated database tests
- **Location**: `tests/database/`
- **Coverage**: Schema validation, constraints, relationships, data integrity

#### Database Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Real database operations testing
- **Coverage**: Migrations, seed data, complex queries, performance

### 4. Performance Testing

#### k6 Load Testing
- **Purpose**: Application performance under load
- **Location**: `tests/performance/`
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database queries, concurrent users

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response Times**: 95th percentile under 500ms
- **Error Rates**: Below 5% under normal load
- **Throughput**: Handles 20+ concurrent users
- **Database**: Query optimization validation

### 5. Google Maps Integration Testing

#### API Key Validation
- **Environment**: VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY configuration
- **Components**: GoogleMapsAutocomplete, EventLocationPicker
- **Coverage**: Location search, coordinate capture, map rendering

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Code Coverage Thresholds
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Lines**: 70%
- **Statements**: 70%

### Critical Path Coverage
- User authentication and authorization
- Post creation and social interactions
- Event management and RSVP workflows
- Real-time messaging and notifications
- Media upload and management
- Role-based access control

## Running Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test:frontend     # Frontend tests only
npm run test:backend      # Backend tests only
npm run test:database     # Database tests only
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Cypress tests
npm run test:e2e:open     # Cypress interactive mode
npm run test:playwright   # Playwright tests
npm run test:playwright:ui # Playwright UI mode
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
npm run test:load         # k6 load testing
npm run test:stress       # Stress testing
npm run test:performance  # Complete performance suite
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Coverage reporting with Codecov
- Performance benchmarking
- Multi-browser compatibility testing

### Test Pipeline Stages
1. **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback on code changes
2. **Integration Tests**: API and database validation
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflow verification
4. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning

## Test Data Management

### Database Seeding
- Automated test data creation
- Consistent data across test environments
- Isolation between test cases
- Cleanup after test completion

### Mock Services
- Google Maps API mocking for offline testing
- External service simulation
- Predictable test environments

## Quality Gates

### Pull Request Requirements
- All tests pass
- Coverage thresholds met
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks within limits

### Release Criteria
- 100% critical path test coverage
- Zero high-severity bugs
- Performance requirements validated
- Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- HTML reports in `coverage/` directory
- Real-time coverage tracking
- Historical coverage trends

### Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles
- Error rate monitoring
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU usage

### Test Results
- JUnit XML for CI integration
- JSON reports for programmatic access
