# 30L Framework Analysis: Design Regression & Admin Center Updates

## Issue Summary
1. Ocean theme (turquoise-blue gradients) has regressed to basic styling
2. Initial page load shows unstyled content before correct styles apply
3. Admin Center needs "23L" â†’ "30L" updates throughout
4. Percentages on each layer need explanation
5. Framework Actions and Documentation features need implementation

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **CSS Loading Issue**: Styles not applied on initial render
2. **Component Classes**: Missing ocean theme classes on main components
3. **Race Condition**: JavaScript loads before CSS applies

## Action Plan
1. Apply ocean theme classes to all main layout components
2. Update all "23L" references to "30L" in admin components
3. Add percentage explanations to framework display
4. Implement Framework Actions functionality
5. Fix CSS loading order to prevent FOUC

## Percentage Explanations
- **90-100%**: Feature complete and production-ready
- **80-89%**: Mostly complete, minor improvements needed
- **70-79%**: Functional but needs optimization
- **60-69%**: Basic implementation, significant gaps
- **50-59%**: Partial implementation, major work needed
- **40-49%**: Early stage, foundational work only
- **30-39%**: Planning/design phase
- **20-29%**: Conceptual/research phase
- **Below 20%**: Future roadmap item
