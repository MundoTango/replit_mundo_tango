# Life CEO Security & Reliability Audit for Mundo Tango
**Date: January 23, 2025**
**Priority: CRITICAL**

## Executive Summary
As Life CEO, I'm implementing comprehensive safeguards to prevent security breaches, data loss, and service failures that could harm Mundo Tango and its users.

## Critical Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Session Security
- [x] Replit OAuth integration (no passwords stored)
- [x] Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- [x] CSRF protection on all forms
- [x] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA) for admin accounts
- [ ] Session timeout after inactivity
- [ ] Suspicious login detection

### 2. Data Protection
- [x] PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) on 40+ tables
- [x] Audit logging for critical operations
- [x] Encrypted sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Automated database backups every 4 hours
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery capability
- [ ] Data export functionality for users

### 3. API Security
- [x] Rate limiting with Redis fallback
- [x] Input validation with Zod schemas
- [x] SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
- [ ] API key rotation system
- [ ] Request signing for critical endpoints
- [ ] DDoS protection

### 4. Error Handling & Monitoring
- [x] Sentry error tracking integration
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [x] Performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Real-time alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Automated incident response
- [ ] User-facing status page

### 5. Infrastructure Resilience
- [x] Graceful degradation (Redis fallback to memory)
- [x] Service worker for offline functionality
- [x] CDN caching for static assets
- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] Automated failover
- [ ] Load balancing

### 6. Privacy & Compliance
- [x] GDPR compliance tracking
- [x] Code of Conduct enforcement
- [x] Report system for violations
- [ ] Privacy policy versioning
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Right to deletion implementation

## Immediate Action Items

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Today)
1. Implement session timeout (30 minutes of inactivity)
2. Add suspicious login detection
3. Enable automated database backups
4. Create user data export endpoint

### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring (This Week)
1. Set up real-time error alerts
2. Create public status page
3. Implement API key rotation
4. Add request signing for payments

### Phase 3: Full Resilience (This Month)
1. Multi-region deployment setup
2. Automated failover configuration
3. Load balancer implementation
4. Comprehensive disaster recovery plan

## Security Checklist

### User Data Protection
- [ ] All user passwords hashed with bcrypt (N/A - using OAuth)
- [x] Session cookies with httpOnly and secure flags
- [x] No sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] PII encryption at rest
- [ ] Secure file upload validation

### API Security
- [x] All endpoints require authentication
- [x] Input validation on all routes
- [x] Rate limiting per user/IP
- [ ] API versioning system
- [ ] Deprecation warnings

### Infrastructure
- [x] HTTPS everywhere
- [x] Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Penetration testing quarterly

## Monitoring Dashboard Metrics
1. Failed login attempts per hour
2. API error rates by endpoint
3. Database query performance
4. Active user sessions
5. Data export requests
6. Security incident count

## Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts via Sentry
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification (P1-P4)
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Fix root cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures

## User Communication Protocol
1. Immediate notification for data breaches
2. Weekly security updates in Admin Center
3. Transparent incident reporting
4. Security best practices education

## Life CEO Commitment
As Life CEO, I guarantee:
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- <24 hour incident response
- Zero tolerance for data breaches
- Continuous security improvements
- User privacy as top priority

## Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 1 security measures NOW
2. Schedule security review meeting
3. Create automated security scorecard
4. Establish bug bounty program
