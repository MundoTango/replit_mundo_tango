# 11L Framework Self-Analysis and Reprompting Strategy

## Layer 1: Business/Product Requirements Analysis
**Current State**: User needs clear Web vs Mobile development breakdown showing what web developers must complete to prepare product for mobile implementation.

**Gap Identified**: While I implemented the UI component for displaying web/mobile status, I haven't delivered the comprehensive analysis showing specifically what web development tasks remain to make the product mobile-ready.

**Required Output**: Detailed breakdown of web development tasks that must be completed before mobile development can begin.

## Layer 2: User Experience & Interface Design
**Current Implementation**: Added CardContent component with web/mobile status display
**Missing Element**: Comprehensive mobile readiness checklist and gap analysis

**User Need**: Clear actionable list of web development work required for mobile handoff

## Layer 3: Frontend/Client Architecture
**Status**: UI components implemented
**Gap**: Need to populate data showing actual web development gaps for mobile readiness

## Layer 4: Backend/Server Architecture  
**Status**: APIs operational
**Gap**: Need analysis of backend API readiness for mobile consumption

## Layer 5: Database & Data Management
**Status**: Database schema supports mobile data needs
**Mobile Readiness**: APIs need mobile-optimized responses

## Layer 6: Authentication & Security
**Status**: Authentication system complete for web
**Mobile Gap**: Need mobile-specific authentication analysis (biometric, app tokens)

## Layer 7: Infrastructure & DevOps
**Status**: Web deployment operational
**Mobile Gap**: Need mobile CI/CD pipeline requirements

## Layer 8: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Status**: Web testing framework established
**Mobile Gap**: Need mobile testing strategy

## Layer 9: Performance & Optimization
**Status**: Web performance optimized
**Mobile Gap**: Need mobile performance considerations

## Layer 10: Analytics & Monitoring
**Status**: Web analytics active
**Mobile Gap**: Need mobile analytics integration requirements

## Layer 11: Documentation & Knowledge Management
**Status**: Partial documentation
**Gap**: Need comprehensive mobile development handoff documentation

## 11L Self-Reprompting Strategy

### Enhanced Prompt for Next Iteration:
"Apply the 11L framework to create a comprehensive Web Development â†’ Mobile Readiness Analysis for Mundo Tango. For each of the 11 layers, identify:

1. **What web development work is COMPLETE and ready for mobile**
2. **What web development work is MISSING and must be completed before mobile development**
3. **Specific mobile architecture requirements that web team must prepare**

### Required Deliverables:
1. **Mobile Readiness Checklist** - Layer-by-layer analysis
2. **Web Development Gap Analysis** - What remains to be done
3. **Mobile Handoff Requirements** - What web team must prepare
4. **Timeline Estimation** - Web work required before mobile can start

### Focus Areas:
- API mobile optimization requirements
- Authentication system mobile preparation
- Database mobile-specific needs
- Performance optimization for mobile consumption
- Testing framework mobile compatibility
- Documentation for mobile team handoff

### Output Format:
Create detailed documentation showing exactly what the web development team must complete across all 11 layers to make the product ready for mobile development team handoff."

## Action Plan
1. Create comprehensive Mobile Readiness Analysis document
2. Populate project tracker with specific web development gaps
3. Generate actionable checklist for web team mobile preparation
4. Update replit.md with mobile development preparation status
