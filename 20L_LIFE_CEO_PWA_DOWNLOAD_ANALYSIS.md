## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix PWA Installability** - Add missing manifest requirements
2. **Create Chat API Endpoint** - Connect frontend to backend
3. **Test Install Flow** - Verify download works on mobile
4. **Implement Basic Agent Response** - At least echo messages back

## User Experience Flow

1. User visits `/life-ceo`
2. Browser shows install prompt (or manual button)
3. User installs PWA to home screen
4. Opens as standalone app
5. Can chat with Life CEO agents
6. Works offline with queued messages
7. Syncs when back online

## Current Blockers

1. **Install not showing:** Missing PWA criteria
2. **Chat not working:** No backend connection
3. **Agents not responding:** Integration incomplete

The UI is ready but needs backend connection and PWA fixes to be fully downloadable and functional.
