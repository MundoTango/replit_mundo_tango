# Layer 25: Real-time Debugging & Diagnostics - Authentication Fix

## Issue Analysis
**Problem**: Admin endpoints returning 401 Unauthorized despite user being super_admin
**Evidence**: 
```
8:23:57 PM [express] GET /api/admin/stats 401 in 17ms :: {"message":"Unauthorized"}
8:23:57 PM [express] GET /api/admin/compliance 401 in 70ms :: {"message":"Unauthorized"}
```

## Debugging Steps Applied

### 1. Network Analysis
- Request includes `credentials: 'include'`
- Session shows auth bypass active
- User ID 7 has super_admin role

### 2. Middleware Chain Analysis
Likely issue: Admin middleware not recognizing the auth bypass pattern

### 3. Authentication Flow Debug
```
🔐 Auth check - req.isAuthenticated(): false
🔐 Auth check - session: undefined
🔧 Auth bypass - using default user for Life CEO testing
```

## Root Cause
The admin endpoints use strict authentication middleware that doesn't respect the auth bypass for development.

## Fix Implementation
Need to update admin middleware to check for development auth bypass.
