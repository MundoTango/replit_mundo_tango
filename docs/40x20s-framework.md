# 40x20s Framework Documentation
## 40 Layers Ã— 20 Phases = Complete Software Development

### Overview
The 40x20s framework is a comprehensive software development methodology that ensures every aspect of a project is thoroughly addressed through 40 architectural layers and 20 development phases.

### Recent Learnings from Production Deployment (July 20, 2025)

#### Critical Issue: Missing Dependencies in Production
- **Problem**: `rate-limiter-flexible` package was missing from package.json causing deployment failures
- **Root Cause**: Dependency was imported and used but never properly tracked
- **Impact**: Production crash loops and failed deployments

#### Framework Improvements Based on Deployment Issue

##### Layer 21 - Dependency Management (Enhanced)
**Previous State**: Basic package management
**Enhanced State**: 
- Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Pre-deployment dependency verification
- Package.json audit before build
- Import/usage vs declaration verification
- Automated dependency health checks

##### Layer 12 - DevOps (Enhanced)
**Previous State**: Basic build and deployment
**Enhanced State**:
- Pre-flight deployment checks
- Dependency resolution verification
- Build artifact validation
- Rollback capability for failed deployments
- Deployment staging with smoke tests

##### Layer 13 - Testing (Enhanced)
**Previous State**: Unit and integration tests
**Enhanced State**:
- Deployment simulation tests
- Dependency resolution tests
- Build process validation
- Production environment mirroring
- Post-deployment health checks

### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple layers simultaneously
2. **Phase Gates**: Complete checkpoints before proceeding
3. **Documentation First**: Document as you build
4. **Testing Throughout**: Test at every phase
5. **Security by Design**: Consider security in every layer

### Deployment Checklist (NEW)

Before any deployment:
- [ ] Run `npm ls` to verify all dependencies
- [ ] Check for untracked imports
- [ ] Verify package.json completeness
- [ ] Run build locally
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Verify all environment variables
- [ ] Check database migrations
- [ ] Review error monitoring setup
- [ ] Confirm rollback procedure
- [ ] Document deployment steps

### MT Ocean Theme Guidelines

For UI components in the 40x20s framework:
- Use glassmorphic design with backdrop blur
- Apply MT ocean color palette (turquoise, cyan, teal)
- Implement smooth transitions and hover effects
- Use gradient backgrounds for cards
- Apply consistent shadow and lighting effects
