# Performance Analysis Using 40x20s Framework

## Critical Performance Issues Detected

### Layer 10 (Deployment & Infrastructure) - CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Platform running "very slow"
- **Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Must fix before any other work

### Performance Bottlenecks Analysis

#### 1. Frontend Issues (Layer 7)
- **React Re-renders**: Components re-rendering unnecessarily
- **Bundle Size**: Large JavaScript bundles blocking initial load
- **Unoptimized Images**: No lazy loading or compression
- **Memory Leaks**: Uncleaned event listeners and subscriptions

#### 2. Backend Issues (Layer 6)
- **Database Queries**: Missing indexes, N+1 queries
- **API Response Times**: No caching, inefficient queries
- **WebSocket Connections**: Too many concurrent connections
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: Causing server overload

#### 3. Database Issues (Layer 5)
- **Missing Indexes**: Slow queries on large tables
- **No Connection Pooling**: Creating new connections per request
- **Unoptimized Queries**: Complex joins without proper indexes
- **No Query Caching**: Repeated expensive queries

#### 4. Infrastructure Issues (Layer 12)
- **No CDN**: Static assets served from origin
- **No Compression**: Large payloads sent uncompressed
- **No HTTP/2**: Missing multiplexing benefits
- **No Service Worker**: No offline caching

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. Enable gzip compression on Express
2. Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
3. Implement React.memo on heavy components
4. Add connection pooling to database

### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (2-4 hours)
1. Implement Redis caching for API responses
2. Optimize database queries (remove N+1)
3. Add lazy loading for images and components
4. Implement request batching

### Phase 3: Infrastructure (4-6 hours)
1. Setup CDN for static assets
2. Implement service worker caching
3. Add HTTP/2 support
4. Optimize bundle splitting

## Performance Metrics to Track
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- API response times
- Database query times

## Success Criteria
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API responses < 200ms
- Database queries < 50ms
- 90% reduction in unnecessary re-renders
